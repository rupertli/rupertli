## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rupert Li, one high school student from [Shanghai Starriver Bilingual School](https://www.ssbs.sh.cn/) in China! I am running one school club "Brain+" to dive into the immense knowledge on neuro science and AI technology. I am one outstanding young performer of Piano. Therefore I hope I can leverage the synergy of AI, Neuro Science and Music to gain insight to address issues caused by degenerative brain neuron cells so that one better way can be found to improve our life quality.
